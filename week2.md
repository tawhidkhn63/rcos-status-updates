Last week I finished learning all the basic PHP and MySQL material and I created a test data base. Now I created an actual database of mock reservations and worked on my part of the project. My job was to work on the back end of the CFS homepage where public events happening would be displayed. I didn't face many blockers and was able to use PHP to create a simple page where a user can select to view today's public events and events that happen tomorrow. Now I am going to learn how to use Vue.js so I can start working on the front end of our project.
