I am completely inexperienced in web dev so this past week I learned how to use Xampp, myPHPadmin, mysql, and how to access all that information using PHP code. My responsibility for this project was to work on the back end of our project's main page. I created a test database with test data and used what I learned in php to connect and access that information. A problem I had was trying to display the data using PHP. The tutorials I used were written 2 or 3 years ago so I had to tinker and modify what they told me to do in order to make up for syntax changes.
